Athletics is the collective name for a collection of sporting events that involve competitors running, 
throwing, walking and jumping. The roots of athletic events are prehistoric, with ancient communities
competing with each other in various running, jumping and throwing events.

Athletic events were prevalent in the ancient Olympics in Greece, starting originally with just a running
race and gratefully expanding over time to include various running, jumping and throwing events. To this 
day, success at the Olympic Games is still seen as the pinnacle of achievement in the sport of Athletics
 – although there  are also World Championships and various national and continental championships both
indoors and outdoors.

<b>Men's Athletics:</b>
Modern day men's athletics includes the following activities:
100 metres

<b>Winning:</b>
Fo involves completing the race in the quickest time possible. For throwing events, it involves
 throwing the furthest and, in jumping events, it involves jumping further or higher than your 
 competitors (depending upon the particular event). In athletics, winners are given a gold medal, 
 those who are second are given a silver medal and bronze medals are given to those who come third.
  Those athletes finishing outside of the top three are not awarded.
